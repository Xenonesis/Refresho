## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide
- Follow PEP 8
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep lines under 80 characters
- Use docstrings for functions/classes

### Example Code Structure
```python
def function_name(param1: type, param2: type) -> return_type:
    """
    Brief description of function.

    Args:
        param1: Description of param1
        param2: Description of param2

    Returns:
        Description of return value

    Raises:
        ErrorType: Description of error condition
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

## Testing Guidelines

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write tests for new features
   - Maintain test coverage
   - Use pytest framework
   - Follow test naming conventions

2. **Test Structure**
```python
def test_feature_name():
    # Arrange
    input_data = ...

    # Act
    result = function_to_test(input_data)

    # Assert
    assert result == expected_output
```

3. **Running Tests**
```bash
python -m pytest tests/
python -m pytest -v  # verbose output
python -m pytest -k "test_name"  # run specific test
```
